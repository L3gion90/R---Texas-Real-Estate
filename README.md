# R---Texas-Real-Estate  

In this descriptive statistics project, we used R to study a dataset relating to the Texas real estate market, containing the following variables:  

- city: city  
- year: reference year  
- month: reference month  
- sales: total number of sales  
- volume: total value of sales in millions of dollars  
- median_price: median sales price in dollars  
- listings: total number of active listings  
- months_inventory: amount of time needed to sell all current listings at the current sales rate, expressed in months.  

We studied the type of variables present and then calculated the various indices of position, variability and shape for all suitable variables, while for the remainder we calculated the frequency distributions. 

This was followed by a study of variability and skewness, frequency distributions for classes, construction of the corresponding bar graph and calculation of the Gini index, all commented on.

This is followed by a brief excursus on some intrinsic probabilities of our variables.

Feature Engineering, creating a variable indicating the average price and another allowing us to understand the ‘effectiveness’ of sales ads.

We continue with EDA and its study.
